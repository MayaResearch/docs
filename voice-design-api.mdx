## How It Works

### Character-Based Generation

Use pre-designed voices from our curated library for consistent, high-quality voices:

```json
{
  "voice_id": "Ava",
  "text": "Welcome back to another episode of our podcast! Today we are diving into an absolutely fascinating topic.",
  "stream": false
}
```

<Note>
  Characters are carefully designed and optimized for specific use cases. Use the Get Characters endpoint to browse all available voice options.
</Note>

**Benefits:**
- **Consistent Quality**: Same voice voiceistics every time
- **Optimized Performance**: Faster generation and processing
- **Domain-Specific**: Characters designed for specific use cases
- **Predictable Output**: Reliable, professional results

## Emotional Expression

The Voice Design API supports rich emotional expression through inline tags within your text:

<CodeGroup>

```json With Emotional Tags
{
  "voice_id": "Emma",
  "text": "<excited> Oh my gosh, you won't believe what happened today! <giggle> It was absolutely incredible. <happy> This is exactly the kind of story I love to share with you all.",
  "stream": false
}
```

```json Simple Generation
{
  "voice_id": "Ava",
  "text": "Welcome back to another episode of our podcast! Today we are diving into an absolutely fascinating topic that I know you're going to love.",
  "stream": false
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Streaming vs Non-Streaming

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Streaming Mode">
    <Icon icon="stream" />
    
    ### Real-Time Audio Streaming
    
    Enable `stream: true` for:
    - **Interactive Applications**: Voice assistants, chatbots
    - **Live Content**: Real-time narration, live podcasts
    - **Low Latency**: Start playing audio immediately as it generates
    - **Long Content**: Begin playback before generation completes
    
    <Note>
      Streaming provides audio chunks as they're generated, reducing perceived latency.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Non-Streaming Mode">
    <Icon icon="file-audio" />
    
    ### Complete Audio File
    
    Use `stream: false` for:
    - **Batch Processing**: Pre-generate audio files
    - **File Storage**: Save complete audio files
    - **Simple Integration**: Receive one complete file
    - **Post-Processing**: Apply effects to complete audio
    
    <Check>Returns complete audio file after full text processing</Check>

{
  "audio": "<binary_audio_data>",
  "metadata": {
    "duration": 5.2,
    "sample_rate": 22050,
    "voice_used": "custom_generated",

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choosing the Right Character">
    - Browse all available voices using the Get Characters endpoint
    - Select voices that match your content domain (podcast, customer service, etc.)
    - Consider the accent and age range appropriate for your target audience
    - Test different voices to find the best fit for your brand
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using Emotional Tags">
    - Place tags just before the text they should affect
    - Don't overuse tags - natural speech has variation without constant emotion switches
    - Test different tags to find what works best for your content
    - Use emotional tags to enhance key moments in your content
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimizing for Performance">
    - Cache voice IDs for consistent, repeated content
    - Enable streaming for interactive applications
    - Break very long text into manageable chunks (under 1,000 voices)
    - Reuse the same voice for consistent brand voice
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Quality Assurance">
    - Test voices with sample text before production use
    - Preview sample audio from the Get Characters endpoint
    - Use verbose mode during development for insights
    - Save successful voice IDs for reuse across your application
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
