## Streaming Response

When `stream` is set to `true`, the API returns audio chunks as they are generated for lower latency:

```javascript Streaming Example
const response = await fetch('https://v3.mayaresearch.ai/v1/tts/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': 'maya_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    voice_id: "Ava",
    text: "Welcome back to another episode of our podcast! Today we're diving into some truly fascinating content that I know you're going to absolutely love.",
    stream: true
  })
});

const reader = response.body.getReader();
const audioChunks = [];

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  audioChunks.push(value);
  
  // Process or play audio chunk immediately for real-time playback
  await playAudioChunk(value);
}

// Optionally combine all chunks for complete audio
const completeAudio = new Blob(audioChunks, { type: 'audio/wav' });
```

<Tip>
  Use streaming mode for:
  - Real-time voice assistants and chatbots
  - Interactive applications where latency matters
  - Long-form content where you want to start playback immediately
  - Live customer support systems
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Character" icon="user-check">
    Browse available characters using the Get Characters endpoint and select one that matches your use case and target audience.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Emotional Tags Effectively" icon="face-smile">
